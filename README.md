# obloadtest
Simple load test for openforbeta.com

This test is demonstrate basic JMeter's features, like  parsing server's response and cycles and conditions.
Now covered only following cases:

As regular user
- Searching for beta-sites
- Viewing random beta-site from search result
- Sending messages to other users (I'm sure that this case doesn't make load, but good for demo)

As anonymous user
- Browsing beta-sites by categories
- Viewing Start page, recent, top and most viewed pages

Unfortunately, cases like "register new user" or "post new site" couldn't be covered due to CAPTCHA defence.
Also, load-test was not executed. 
Please note, not  because I can't. Just because DOS-ing sites and hacking captcha are cyber crimes.
